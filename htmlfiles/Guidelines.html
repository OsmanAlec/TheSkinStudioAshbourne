			<p><strong>Arrival guidelines:</strong> Please arrive 5-10 minutes prior to the start of your scheduled appointment to allow yourself time to fill in a new or updated consultation form or use the bathroom. Late arrivals will be subject to reduced treatment times.</p>
            <p><strong>Children on the premises:</strong> Due to the high-risk treatments we carry out and our insurance regulations, children are not permitted in the treatment room with a parent/care giver at any stage of a treatment. Children may wait in the reception area, but must be supervised by a parent/care-giver. Please note: Staff cannot supervise children while at reception.</p>
            <p><strong>Minimum age:</strong> Experts treat clients from the age of 14 and upwards with parental consent. Parents have to present themselves. Not all treatments are available to minors. Please enquire at reception for further details on this.</p>
            <p><strong>Services: The Skin Studo Ashbourne</strong> Does require the client to come in so we as a company can talk to you in person to see the condition of the complaint ourselves. We will not make commitments or refunds simply over the phone.</p>
            <p><strong>What to wear:</strong> Please note that we use skincare products before and after treatments, which may transfer onto clothing. To avoid any inconvenience, we suggest opting for casual, loose clothing during your appointment to allow your skin to remain unrestricted post-treatment.</p>
            <p><strong>Medical concerns and comfort level:</strong> Guests who are pregnant, have had recent surgery or have any other medical concerns are advised to consult their Therapist before booking treatments.</p>
            <p><strong>Mobile phones, personal electronic devices and cameras:</strong> We strive to provide our clients with a professional and private experience. Please help us by turning off cell phones, personal electronic devices and cameras upon entering.</p>
            <p><strong>Cancellations:</strong> We understand that everyone occasionally has an emergency or something prevents them from coming to their scheduled appointment. Please call whenever possible. As a courtesy to all, we ask that a 24-hour notice be given if you need to cancel or change your appointment. For a cancellation with less than a 24-hour notification, guests will be charged 50% of the treatment fee. For no-show appointments, the full treatment fee will be charged.</p>
            <p><strong>Our refund policy: </strong> We will only issue store credit or voucher amount for any services/products The Skin Studio Ashbourne feels is deserving of a refund. The Skin Studio Ashbourne reserves the right to enforce corporate policies and make the decision of whether a refund or Gift certificates should be issued due to unsatisfactory service.</p>
            <p>The Skin Studio Ashbourne will only give store credit for any refunds that would be justified or approved by corporate policies. Our skin studio does not give cash, check or credit card refunds for any reason for any services. We will fix the complaint to the clients and The Skin Studio Ashbourne satisfaction. We will always make a good faith effort to make sure you are happy and satisfied under reasonable circumstances.</p>
            <p><strong>Voucher policy:</strong> Vouchers purchased are non-refundable after purchase. Vouchers can be used for products or services or studio gifts. Vouchers can be used for an euro amount for the treatment indicated on the vouchers. Vouchers can be gifted to another person if wanted, and then the voucher will be used and zeroed out. The physical voucher must be presented when checking into The Skin Studio Ashbourne at time of service. Vouchers will not be used if not physically given to the check in coordinator; you must use some other form of payment if you do not have the voucher with you. You can use it the next time you come in.</p>
            <p><strong>Please also note:</strong></p>
            <p>*We will only allow 3 days after an unsatisfactory service for a client to call back to talk to the Manager about a service if not satisfied in order to hear the complaint and come to a resolution.</p>
