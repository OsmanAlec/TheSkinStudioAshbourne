Website Development for The Skin Studio Ashbourne

In my first year, first semester, I developed and maintained the official website for The Skin Studio Ashbourne. This project gave me practical experience in creating a user-friendly, responsive site while emphasizing the importance of writing clean, maintainable code. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap to design and implement the website’s features, ensuring it worked seamlessly across different devices.

For hosting and management, I utilized cPanel and HostIreland, where I deployed the website and handled ongoing maintenance tasks. This provided me with insight into the challenges of maintaining a live site, optimizing code for performance, and ensuring that updates didn’t break existing functionality. One of the key challenges I faced was balancing the need for a flexible, scalable design with the requirements of maintainable code for future updates.

Working on this project taught me the importance of clean code practices and gave me real-world experience in web development, from front-end design to back-end hosting management.
